## Lab 06 - Challenge

A culmination of several embedded systems concepts into one lab. This lab is loosely based on the project “blinky” in the workspace “TM4C1294_RTOS_IAR9-main” (from the previously mentioned [repository (RTOS)](https://github.com/ELF74-SisEmb/TM4C1294_RTOS_IAR9)), although it also used concepts from projects "prodcons" and "tarefas" as well:
* osMessageQueueId_t initialization and functions;
* Creation of appropriate diagrams to model the software;
* Combine threads, mutexes, queues, flags and interruptions.

### HEADS-UP
